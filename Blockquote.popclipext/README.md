### Blockquote

Turn indented text (or any text) into nested Markdown blockquotes.

* Clicking adds a ">" for each indentation level in the selected text
* Command-click to decrease quote level
* Command-Option-click key to remove all quoting

When adding quote levels, multiple line breaks between lines creates separate block quotes (by design). If there's a single blank line between to paragraphs, they'll be joined together as paragraphs within a blockquote. More than one starts a new quote.
