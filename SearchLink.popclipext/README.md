BulletList
===

PopClip extension to turn lines of text into Markdown bullet items. Indentation is handled as nested lists and existing markers are overwritten (numbered list becomes bullet list).

### Numbered lists

Holding Option (⌥) while clicking the button for the extension in the PopClip bar will create/update a numbered list instead. When the list is already a numbered list, it will be re-numbered to fix any gaps or out-of-order numbering within nest levels.

### Clear list formatting

Holding Command (⌘) while clicking will remove all list prefixes.

### Bullet format

When you install this extension, you'll get an options page where you can select the type of bullet you prefer for unordered lists. This can be accessed again later by clicking the pencil button at the bottom of the list, then clicking the gear button next to the BulletList extension.
