WebMarkdown
===

Also known as WebMD, this extension shows up when you select text on a web page. Clicking it will convert the selected headlines, text and links (including image links) to Markdown in your clipboard.

This extension uses [Gather](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/gather-cli) to markdownify the selection. If you don't have the `gather` CLI installed, WebMarkdown will offer to download and install it for you the first time you run it.
