### CheckURLs

PopClip extension to show a popup preview for each URL in selected text. Used for confirming the output of scripts like SearchLink without switching to the browser.

Links are shown sequentially in the order they're found. If a URL is changed by following links in the preview and pressing "OK", the selected text will be updated with the final URL. Because of this, duplicate links in the text are all previewed so they can be modified individually.
